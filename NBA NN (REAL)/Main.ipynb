    "Explanation of what I did:\n",
    "I imported my data from Kaggle and dropped some columns that had too many Nans.\n",
    "I changed the given column of Draft Picks, giving every player drafted in the top 3 a '1' and all others a '0.'\n",
    "I also experimented with dropping every Nan but I found that making them 0 actually improved accuracy.\n",
    "I split the DF into X: all columns except the target column and Y: Draft pick (the target column).\n",
    "I scaled X so that columns with smaller values (such as sprint) mattered just as much to the model.\n",
    "I created a model with four layers of nodes and dropout after every layer so that all nodes would adjust.\n",
    "My best accuracy was with 150 epochs and 3 splits (97%), so I stuck with that after a lot of experimentation.\n",
    "I fit my data to the model so that I could test its accuracy with predictions.\n",
    "I took rows from the original X dataframe to test with predictions (I had to make them into Dataframes to work with the model).\n",
    "Unfortunately, my model only predicts zeros, but I think I understand why. So many of my rows had 0 as the answer that the model just assumed it should return 0. Unless I did something wrong codewise, this is the only logical explanation. So, while my accuracy was very good when fitting the model, it was unable to predict. Online, I found ideas that said to change 'relu' activation function to 'tanh' or 'LeakyReLU' but neither of those helped. I spent a while trying to get good predictions, but ultimately I decided that it was probably never going to happen, as the data was just too skewed towards 0.\n",
    "I would probably give myself an A/A- on this project because I intentionally chose difficult data to challenge myself and spent a lot of time trying to improve my model (even though it didn't quite work out). However, I never thought I would get 97% after seeing all of the Nans in the dataframe and knowing that top-3 NBA picks weren't always the most athletic and tallest, so I think that I did a good job overall."
